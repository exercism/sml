# Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Running the tests

Even though there are multiple implementations, we encourage to use Poly/ML.

```
$ poly -q < test_{ exercise }.sml
```

If you want to start an interactive session:
```
$ poly --use test_{ exercise }.sml
```
