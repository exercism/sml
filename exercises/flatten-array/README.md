# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.
 
For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]


## Running the tests

Even though there are multiple implementations, we encourage to use Poly/ML.

```
$ poly -q < test_{ exercise }.sml
```

If you want to start an interactive session:
```
$ poly --use test_{ exercise }.sml
```
