# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

## Hints

You can think of this data structure as a [`Rose Tree`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree). You are given a data type `'a tree` that represents this data structure.

**Notes**
- For this exercise `Empty` represents `null`
- The nested list is represented by `List [...]`.
- The input example is represented by `List [Elem 1, List [Elem 2, Elem 3, Empty, Elem 4], List [Empty], Elem 5]`


## Loading your exercise implementation in PolyML

```
$ poly --use {exercise}.sml
```

Or:

```
$ poly
> use "{exercise}.sml";
```

**Note:** You have to replace {exercise}.

## Running the tests

```
$ poly -q --use test.sml
```
