# Hints

You can think of this data structure as a [`Rose Tree`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree). You are given a data type `'a tree` that represents this data structure.

**Notes**
- For this exercise `Empty` represents `null`
- The nested list is represented by `List [...]`.
- The input example is represented by `List [Elem 1, List [Elem 2, Elem 3, Empty, Elem 4], List [Empty], Elem 5]`
